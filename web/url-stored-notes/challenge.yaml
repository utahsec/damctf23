# these are files that are given to the player. if you need things from the container (i.e. compiled binary, libc),
# push the challenge branch and download the artifacts from the CI/CD job
# if no files are provided, delete this block
provide:
- ./dist/url-notes.zip

# this should usually be the flag file so that it doesn't get out of sync if you change it
flag:
