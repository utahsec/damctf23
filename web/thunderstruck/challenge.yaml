# these are files that are given to the player. if you need things from the container (i.e. compiled binary, libc),
# push the challenge branch and download the artifacts from the CI/CD job
# if no files are provided, delete this block
provide:
- ./thunderstruck.zip

# this should usually be the flag file so that it doesn't get out of sync if you change it
flag:
  file: ./flag

# visible controls rCTF status, deployed controls k8s status. THESE SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME
visible: true
deployed: true

# specify the containers to be built
# replicas should be 2 unless resource intensive (>2) or stateful (1)
# make sure to update the port for what you are exposing in the Dockerfile
#containers:
#  main:
#    build: .
#    replicas: 2
#    ports:
#    - 31337

# make sure to only expose the target container (i.e. http but not mysql)
#expose:
#  main:
#  - target: 5000 # this is the container's EXPOSE port
#    # @AUTHOR PICK ONE OF THE BELOW, NOT BOTH
#    http: thunderstruck  # creates traefic ingress record based on hostname (don't change the value)
