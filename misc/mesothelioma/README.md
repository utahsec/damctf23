## Info

Geoint challenge about finding a sign in the Clear Creek Management Area.

Intended solution:

- whats that triangle logo? BLM
- what BLM property has asbestos? Clear Creek
- reverse image search / article search
- find article with another image of sign
  - https://www.sfgate.com/green/article/SAN-BENITO-COUNTY-Curbing-off-road-recreation-2749702.php#photo-2188639
- that image has more context on where the sign is
  - another BLM sign in the background
  - a road split
  - two trees
- based on that, its in front of / just under the first tree
  - rounded to the nearest second:
