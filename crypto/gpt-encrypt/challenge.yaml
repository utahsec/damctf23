  I needed a block cipher to encrypt my flag, but I don't trust AES, so I asked ChatGPT to write one for me.

  Note: the file `gpt.py` is almost directly copied from ChatGPT output, with some minor modifications to make it a valid python script.

# these are files that are given to the player. if you need things from the container (i.e. compiled binary, libc),
# push the challenge branch and download the artifacts from the CI/CD job
# if no files are provided, delete this block
provide:
- ./src/chal.py
- ./src/gpt.py
- ./output.txt

# this should usually be the flag file so that it doesn't get out of sync if you change it
flag:
  file: ./flag

# visible controls rCTF status, deployed controls k8s status. THESE SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME
visible: true
deployed: true
