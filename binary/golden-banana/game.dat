15 You wake up in a bright and wonderful room. You have no idea how you got here or where you are. You look around and see nothing but walls of golden bananas. They are piled up from floor to ceiling, filling every inch of space. You can smell their delicious and enticing aroma, and you feel a surge of joy and excitement. You wonder if this is a dream or a miracle. You don't care about finding a way out, because this is the best place ever. There are no doors or windows, but you don't need them. There are no signs of life or civilization, but you don't miss them. There is only you and the bananas. You feel free and happy. You notice a cute flag hanging from one of the banana piles. It has some letters and numbers on it: dam{forM4t_5TRiN95_M4k3_m3_9O_b4N4n45} You don't know what it means or who put it there, but you think it's a nice touch. You wonder if this is some kind of reward or gift. You wonder if you will ever leave this room. But then you realize that you don't want to. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU WIN!
