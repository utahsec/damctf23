  `nc {{ host }} {{ port }}`

# these are files that are given to the player. if you need things from the container (i.e. compiled binary, libc),
# push the challenge branch and download the artifacts from the CI/CD job
# if no files are provided, delete this block
provide:
- ./golden-banana.tar.gz

# this should usually be the flag file so that it doesn't get out of sync if you change it
flag:
  file: ./flag

# visible controls rCTF status, deployed controls k8s status. THESE SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME
visible: true
deployed: true

# specify the containers to be built
# replicas should be 2 unless resource intensive (>2) or stateful (1)
# make sure to update the port for what you are exposing in the Dockerfile
containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 2
    ports:

# make sure to only expose the target container (i.e. http but not mysql)
expose:
  main:
  - target: 31337 # this is the container's EXPOSE port
    tcp: 30234  # raw NodePort that is exposed publicly (use this for nc chals). must be unique and within 30000-32767
